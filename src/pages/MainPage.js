Just think about it as virtual goods, which you can actually own and store in your wallet. It can be a piece of art, ticket, video, music, almost everything what's digital."/>

                    <FaqTab header="WHAT IS DAO?" content="DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organisation. It gives the community ability to vote and cooporate online without any middleman or risks of being scammed. That's because it's just a transparent code everyone can see and review. In DAO there is usually a voting system. Once something is voted out(for example 50% vote for 'yes'), then the predetermined code is executed. That's basically how it works. All of this usually takes place in your browser, using your cryptocurrency wallet."/>

Once your wallet is on our list, you will have to visit our website at the predetermined time(we will announce it a few days before the mint), click the mint button and approve transaction! If you are new to the NFT space here is what you should do: setup your wallet(type in browser: How to setup metamask?), buy ETH(it can be done on every major cryptocurrency exchange for example Coinbase or Binance), transfer crypto to your wallet(type in your browser something like: How to transfer ETH from Coinbase to Metamask). That's it! Now the only thing you have to do is to get on our whitelist and buy when the time comes!"/>
